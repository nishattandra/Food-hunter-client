                <p>Props are used to passing the read-only attributes to React components. For the proper functioning of components and to avoid future bugs and glitches it is necessary that props are passed correctly. Hence, it is required to use props validation for improving react componentâ€™s performance. React JS has an inbuilt feature for validating props data type to make sure that values passed through props are valid. React components have a property called propTypes which is used to setup data type validation.</p>
                <h3>React PropTypes Validators</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> PropTypes.any: This means the prop can be of any data type.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.bool: This means the prop should be a boolean.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.number: This means the prop should be a number.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.string: This means the prop should be a string.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.func: This means the prop should be a function.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.array: This means the prop should be an array.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.object: This means the prop should be an object.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.symbol: This means the prop should be a symbol.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.instanceOf: This means the prop should be an instance of a particular JavaScript class.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.isRequired: This means the prop should be provided.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.oneOf(): This means the props should be one of several types of specified values.</li>
                    <li> PropTypes.element: This means the props must be an element.</li>
                </ol>
